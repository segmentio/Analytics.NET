Analytics.NET
=============

Analytics.NET is a .NET / C# client for [Segment](https://segment.com).  This .Net library has been updated to be StyleCop compliant, as well as adding support for the Unity Engine 5.3 and later.  The Unity implementation also has a rudimentry way of saving all analytic events to disk if an internet connection is lost and the application has to shut down.  This package should work for all platforms except WebGL/WebPlayer, but has only been tested on iOS, Android, Windows and Mac.

It does have a dependency on "Json.NET for Unity" https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/11347.
